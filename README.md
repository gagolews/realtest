## Where Expectations Meet Reality: Realistic Unit Testing in [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

Realistic unit tests can be used to formalise:

* assertions ("must-haves")
* alternative behaviours ("could-also-haves")
* feature requests ("would-like-to-haves")
* current behaviour that we'd like to have changed in the future ("now-haves")

The introduced vocabulary is (and will be kept!) minimalistic.
