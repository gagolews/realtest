\title{Create a Result Descriptor by Recording Effects of an Expression Evaluation}
\usage{
R(expr, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{a formal argument to be evaluated}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to \code{\link{P}}}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{realtest_descriptor},
see \code{\link{P}}, which this function calls.
The additional named component \code{expr} gives the
expression used to generate the \code{value}.

If an effect of particular kind does not occur,
it is not included in the resulting list.
\code{stdout}, \code{stderr}, and \code{error} are at most single strings.

When an error occurs, \code{value} is \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
Evaluates an expression and records its direct and indirect effects:
the resulting value as well as the information whether any errors,
warnings, or messages are generated and if anything on
\code{\link[base]{stdout}} or \code{\link[base]{stderr}} is printed.
}
\details{
Note that messages, warnings, and errors are typically written to
\code{\link[base]{stderr}}, but these are considered separately here.
In other words, when testing expectations with \code{\link{E}},
e.g., the reference \code{stderr} should not include the anticipated
diagnostic messages.

There may be other side effects, such as changing the state of
the random number generator, modifying options or environment variables,
modifying the calling or global environment (e.g., creating new global
variables), attaching objects onto the search part (e.g., loading
package namespaces), or plotting, but these are not captured,
at least, not in the current version of the package.

\examples{
R(sum(1:10))
R(cat("a bit talkative, innit?"))
R(sqrt(c(-1, 0, 1, 2, 4)))
R(log("aaaargh"))
R({
    cat("STDOUT"); cat("STDERR", file=stderr()); message("MESSAGE");
    warning("WARNING"); warning("WARNING AGAIN"); cat("MORE STDOUT");
    message("ANOTHER MESSAGE"); stop("ERROR"); "NO RETURN VALUE"
})
