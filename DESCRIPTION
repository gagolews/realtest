Title: When Expectations Meet Reality: Realistic Unit Testing
Description:
    We are all adults here. We can't always get what we want.
    Such is life. You may say we're dreamers, but we're not the only ones:
    in an ideal world, things could look different, there could be more
    or less of this and that. Sometimes, there might be many equally correct
    outcomes. Other behaviours are good enough for now, but we shall improve
    them eventually, say, during the 2027 summer holidays. Sometimes, what we
    have is barely acceptable, but we need to live with it: it is
    scheduled to be fixed when we have time. Or when other dependencies
    will finally take our feedback into account and accept that series of
    bug fixes and enhancements. Sad but true, one needs to be patient.
    The following is a framework for unit testing for realistic minimalists,
    where we distinguish between expected, acceptable, current, fallback,
    and regressive behaviour. It can also be used for monitoring other
    software projects for changes.
