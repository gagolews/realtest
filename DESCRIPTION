Description: We are all adults here. We can't always get what we want.
    Such is life. You may say we're dreamers, but we're not the only ones:
    in an ideal world, things could look different, there could be more
    or less of this and that. Sometimes, there might be many equally correct
    outcomes. Other behaviours are good enough for now, but we might
    improve them eventually, say, during next summer holidays.
    Sometimes, what we have is barely acceptable,
    but we need to live with it: to be fixed when we have time.
    Or when other dependencies will finally take our feedback seriously
    and accept a series of bug fixes and enhancements.
    Sad but true, one needs to be patient.
    The following is a framework for unit testing for
    realistic minimalists, where we distinguish between
    expected, acceptable, and undesirable behaviour.
