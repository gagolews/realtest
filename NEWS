## 0.2.1 (2021-06-17)

* [NEW FEATURE] `sides_comparer` is now solely responsible for
  defining the semantics of side effect prototypes, therefore
  `P` performs only few non-invasive sanity checks of its arguments.

* [BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY] Example comparer `identical_or_TRUE`
  is no longer available.

* [BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY] `maps_identical_or_TRUE` has been renamed
  `sides_similar` and now allows for ignoring the side effects
  indicated by the user.

* [BUGFIX] `summary.realtest_results` no longer tries to subset symbols.


## 0.1.2 (2021-06-03)

* [BUGFIX] `test_dir` does not modify the global environment anymore.

* [BUGFIX] `test_dir` now evaluates tests in a temporary environment
  whose parent is the caller's envir, not `namespace:realtest`.
