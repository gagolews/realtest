# Changelog

> The reference manual is available at <https://realtest.gagolewski.com>.


## 0.2.3 (2023-05-15)

* [NEW FEATURE] `R` (and hence `E` too) now returns
  a named list of objects passed thereto as arguments,
  e.g., `R(y^2)` extracts `y` together with its value from the
  parent environment.

* [BUGFIX] Self-unit tests no longer depend on `LC_LANGUAGE`.

* [BUGFIX] The package requires R >= 4.0.


## 0.2.1 (2021-06-17)

* [NEW FEATURE] `sides_comparer` is now solely responsible for
  defining the semantics of side effect prototypes, therefore
  `P` performs only few non-invasive sanity checks of its arguments.

* [BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY] Example comparer `identical_or_TRUE`
  is no longer available.

* [BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY] `maps_identical_or_TRUE` has been renamed
  `sides_similar` and now allows for ignoring the side effects
  indicated by the user.

* [BUGFIX] `summary.realtest_results` no longer tries to subset symbols.


## 0.1.2 (2021-06-03)

* [BUGFIX] `test_dir` does not modify the global environment anymore.

* [BUGFIX] `test_dir` now evaluates tests in a temporary environment
  whose parent is the caller's envir, not `namespace:realtest`.


## 0.1.1 (2021-06-01)

* [NEW FEATURE] Core functions: `E`, `P`, `R`.

* [NEW FEATURE] Example comparers.

* [NEW FEATURE] Example postprocessors.

* [NEW FEATURE] Example batch case processing/reporting: `test_dir`,
  `print.realtest_results_summary`, and `summary.realtest_results`.


## 0.0.0 (2021-05-27)

* The *realtest* project has been established.
